The Lone Lighthouse Keeper: Old Man Jacob lived in a lighthouse, alone with his cat. Each night, he watched the waves crash, waiting for the ships to pass safely. One stormy night, he saw a ship in distress and sent out a flare. The shipâ€™s crew was saved, and they brought gifts to thank him. Jacob realized he was never truly alone; he had the sea and his duty.
