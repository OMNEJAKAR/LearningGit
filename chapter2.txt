The Whispering Wind: In a small village, children said the wind could talk. Little Lily listened closely every day. One day, the wind whispered, "Follow me." She ran to the forest and found an injured fawn. She nursed it back to health, and they became inseparable friends. The villagers called her the "Wind Whisperer."
